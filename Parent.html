        Should I be a friend or a parent to my child? Should we put our child into an International school or an alternative school? How do I talk to my child about the ‘birds and the bees’? How do I explain to my six year old where babies come from? What should I do if I catch my child smoking?
Parenting from the word 'go'is a roller coaster ride. It is unpredictable and you can never be fully prepared!

The fast changing Indian social scenario has made parenting more complex. Indian parents today have to balance tradition with living in a world that is hyper connected. Trends, fads, internet, Whatsapp, Facebook, International schools, alternative schools, baby blues …  everything has to be understood, managed and balanced.

Parenting Tips for Indian Parents takes a comprehensive look at issues that arise from the time one thinks of having a baby until the time the child steps into adulthood. It helps understand the various stages of growth and development vis-a-vis physical, emotional, cognitive development. It offers insight into practical parenting, preparing for the second child, dealing with issues of a single child, understanding intelligence and personality besides understanding teenage and its issues. 
To help parents get the benefit of traditional knowledge and expertise, many traditional Indian 'dadi ka nuskhaas'to cope with minor ailments and improve health, which were common knowledge once but are getting lost with time, have also been incorporated.

        From a Harvard faculty member and oral language specialist, an invaluable guide that gives readers evidence-based tools and techniques to communicate more effectively with children in ways that let them foster relationships with less conflict and more joy and kindness.

Science has shown that the best way to help our kids become independent, confident, kind, empathetic, and happy is by talking with them. Yet, so often, parents, educators, and caregivers have trouble communicating with kids. Conversations can feel trivial or strained—or worse, are marked by constant conflict.

 In The Art of Talking with Children, Rebecca Rolland, a Harvard faculty member, speech pathologist, and mother, arms adults with practical tools to help them have productive and meaningful conversations with children of all ages—whether it’s engaging an obstinate toddler or getting the most monosyllabic adolescent to open up.

The Art of Talking with Children shows us how quality communication—or rich talk—can help us build the skills and capacities children need to thrive.
